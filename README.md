> #### DB887 (Ministry of Communicaions)
> Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra (DNK) is an initiative of the Department of Posts and CBIC, wherein the small exporters are able to electronically file a Portal Bill of Export and then present the parcel at DNK for export. 122 DNKs have so far been opened in Post Offices and 878 more shall be opened in the next two years. Although DNKs are being used by 800+ exporters, DoP is still not able to bring small traders, artisans and MSMEs onto the DNK platform as most of such entrepreneurs do not have the wherewithal to create web portals for displaying their products and accepting International e-Commerce orders, or they are find the regulatory and e-Commerce platform compliances too expensive or tedious. Moreover, the international customers find it difficult to trust the webportals or small entities. The private e-Commerce portals charge upto 40% of the sale price of orders, which is prohibitively expensive. Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra" refers to a concept in the Indian postal system. It translates to ""Post Office Export Centre"" in English. The Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra is a specialized facility within a post office that offers services related to export of goods.The establishment of Dak Ghar Niryat Kendra aims to simplify and streamline the export process for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by leveraging the extensive postal network and infrastructure already in place. It provides exporters with a cost-effective and accessible solution for their export logistics requirements."
